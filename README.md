# cjko-draw
A sketchbook for hosting Processing sketches online. Made using React. 
It is hosted on Heroku [here](https://cjko-sketchbook.herokuapp.com/admin/sketches).

Additional palettes may be added by creating a palette at https://coolors.co/.  Once you have a palette that is pleasing, copy the URL of the palette into the palette form on cjko.draw.  The palette will be utilized when you load each sketch.
